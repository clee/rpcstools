The only feature currently available is the update-rpcs3-games command, it can be run from anywhere on Linux and has to be run on the rpcs3 folder on Windows. This tool will find all your installed games through the games.yml file and through the dev_hdd0/games folder and automatically download its updates to the game_updates folder.
